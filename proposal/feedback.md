Great high-level framing here. For experiments, the two things you absolutely want to nail early are: **(1)** making your evaluation splits *match the original leaderboard semantics* (in particular, some tasks assume capture-level isolation or temporal splits even when not stated explicitly), because using a plain random split will silently inflate results and make “reproduction” look better than it should; and **(2)** locking down exact **nPrint/pcapML parameters** (hash size, packet count, padding, flow windowing), since even minor changes produce different feature tensors and will break reproducibility. Once those foundations are consistent, your cross-task leaderboard, ablations, and modest model extensions will land cleanly and give you meaningful, comparable numbers across the board.
